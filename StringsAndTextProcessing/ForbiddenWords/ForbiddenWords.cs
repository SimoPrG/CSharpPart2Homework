/*Problem 9. Forbidden words

    We are given a string containing a list of forbidden words and a text containing some of these words.
    Write a program that replaces the forbidden words with asterisks.

Example text: Microsoft announced its next generation PHP compiler today. It is based on .NET Framework 4.0 and is implemented as a dynamic language in CLR.

Forbidden words: PHP, CLR, Microsoft

The expected result: ********* announced its next generation *** compiler today. It is based on .NET Framework 4.0 and is implemented as a dynamic language in ***.
